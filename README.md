Here are the map reduce programs that I have coded during my college days.
Task1 : These are the map reduce files that were supposed to do find the number of occurrences of a given word, that has been marked as recognized .Find the number of occurrences of the same word that was not marked as recognized and whose timestamp falls on a weekend - {Saturday,Sunday} in the dataset.
Task2 : Given a specific word, count the number of occurrences of that word per country.
Output should be sorted in alphabetical order of countries
An occurence of the word should only be considered if the Euclidean
distance between the 0th coordinates of the first stroke and the origin is
greater than a given distance k.
Both specified word and distance k should be command line arguments.
The first argument should be the word, and the second argument should
be the distance k.
